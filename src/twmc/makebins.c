DESCRIPTION:determines number of bins for overlap calculation
CONTENTS:   makebins( INT )
DATE:	    Feb 13, 1988 
REVISIONS:
	    Feb 27, 1988 - now called from config1 and calculates
		numbins based on cell area. In future, use variance.
	    Mar  1, 1988 - added variance.
	    Nov 20, 1988 - fixed aspect ratio.
