FILE:	    utemp.c                                       
DESCRIPTION:outer loop of the simulated annealing algorithm.
CONTENTS:   utemp( )
DATE:	    Feb 5, 1988 
REVISIONS:  Dec 3, 1988 - added output info for timing.
	    Dec 4, 1988 - moved output info to prnt_cost routine and
			    updated arguments to savewolf.
	    Feb 20,1989 - recoded annealing loop to make it easier 
		to read.
	    Mar 01,1989 - changed iter_countS to iteration a global.
		removed all static code.
	    Mar 02,1989 - removed fuloop from code.
	    Jun 21,1989 - added verbose switch to iteration number.
	    Oct 14,1990 - added overlap iterations.
	    Fri Jan 25 18:09:20 PST 1991 - removed unnecessary globals.
