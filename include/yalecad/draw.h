Function:
    Initialization of graphics package.  Needs to be called first.
    Argc is the number of arguments passed on the command line.
    Argv is the argument vector.
    Colors is an array of strings of the desired colors.  The
    colors must agree with the standard color map of the machine and
    in addition element 1 must be "white" and element two "black". Also
    element 0 is not used at this time.  Use TWstdcolors to use 
    the graphics packages builtin standard colors.
    NumC is the number of colors in the color array counting white and
    black.
    DumpOnly should normally be set to FALSE.  It should be only set to
    TRUE if you wish to only dump the DATA to the DATADIRECTORY.
    MenuPath is the pathname of the menu file.
    Refresh_func is the address of the function which repaints
    the entire drawing area.
    NOTE: it is advised that the TimberWolf standard colors be used if
    possible.  Use TWstdcolors() for argument colors and TWnumcolors()
    for numC arg and use include file <yalecad/colors.h>.
