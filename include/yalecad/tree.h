extern YTREEPTR Ytree_init( P2(INT compare_func(), INT offset ) ) ;
/* 
Arguments:
    INT compare_func() ;
    INT offset ;
Function:
    Initializes a binary tree.  The user should supply a compare
    comparison function similar to the one used by the UNIX 
    quicksort routine.  The function compare_func is assumed to have
    two arguments which are pointers to the arguments being compared.
    The function should return an integer less than, equal to, or
    greater than 0 according as the first argument is to be considered
    less than, equal to , or greater than the second.  Offset is
    the distance in bytes that the key is offset from the beginning
    of the data record.  The function returns a pointer to the
    tree data structure. Use the tree pointer returned by Ytree_init 
    for all routines to work on this tree.  The macro YTREE_INIT 
    has been designed to make calling this routine easier. 
    The macro has the following syntax: 
    YTREE_INIT( tree, compare_func, datarecordname, keyname )
    where tree is the name of the returned tree.  Compare_func is
    the name of the compare function.  Data record name is the name
    of the record to be stored, and key name is the field to be
    used as the key to the record.

    get all the remaining members of the tree.  Returns a pointer
